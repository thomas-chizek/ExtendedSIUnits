## Test app: UWP C# and .NET 4.6.1

Illustrates using `UnitsNet.WindowsRuntimeComponent` from an UWP C# app.
The Windows Runtime Component nuget can be consumed from C#, JavaScript and C++ UWP apps.

NOTE: Normally for C# UWP apps you would use the more feature-rich `UnitsNet` nuget, since Windows Runtime Component
only supports some of the .NET BCL types and has many constraints on how the public API of the library can be declared.
