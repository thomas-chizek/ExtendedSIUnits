# ExtendedSIUnits
Based on UnitsNet extended to cover units needed for solar system and beyond measurements.

Specifically for masses above Megatonne, distances above Kilometer, and eventually force, energy, and velocity units larger than Meganewtons, Megajoules, or Meter/Second^2. 
Most of the base SI units get unwieldy at best when extended to cosmic scales. While it is hard to visualize a Megameter, it is easier to visualize than 1,000,0000 Meters, saying it is 1,000 Kilometers is a bit easier, saying 1 Megameter is a bit more than the distance from Detroit Michigan to Charlotte North Carolina shows the scale of a MM reasonably well. Likewise, a Gigameter is more comfortable to visualize as about 2.5 times the distance from the earth to the moon while the distance to Saturn is nice short 1.2 Terameters or 1.32 light-hours.
You can see from the brief breakdown working with meters or even kilometers on any distances beyond the solar system becomes unwieldy very fast. Even the outer edges of the solar system are problematic. 

Masses are just as bad, working with masses of even small asteroids or moons involve hundreds of millions of kilograms for the smallest while stars start at 10^21 kilotonnes and go up from there.
